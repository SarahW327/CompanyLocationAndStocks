# CompanyLocationAndStocks

## Overview

### Purpose

#### Topic

We are investing the impacts geographic locations of companies on their stock performances.  

#### Reasoning

There are multiple pockets in the country that are at risk for becoming modern-day ghost towns based on decreases in economic activities.  These cities can benefit from diversifying the types of work available by introducing new businesses from other sectors that are already visibly successful, especially using stock performance as a metric.  As a result of introducing these new businesses, communities will seek to invest in them and boost local economies long-term as opposed to shifting focus to other cities or only setting up short-term plans.  If it isn't necessary for a company to be located in the same general area as other companies that operate similarly, local communites can benefit greatly.

#### Questions to Answer

1) When investigating the performance of companies by their stocks, do geographical locations have a significant impact in comparison to other factors such as the size of the company or revenue?
2) Is it necessary to move the locations of headquarters to cities that have high concentrations of other company headquarters within the same sectors in order to improve stock performance?
