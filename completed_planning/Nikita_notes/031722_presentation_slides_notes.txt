rough notes for presentation slides
-----------------------------------------------------
-- don't overwhelm your audience
-- remember what you're trying to convey/prove

- looking for 5 - 6 slides?

- overview/purpose slide

- proposed interactive slide:
	- checking the performance of a stock over the period of a month for the duration of 2 years of data

- "earthquake map" with dots
- each dot would be placed on the map using latitude/longitude information
- each dot would contain the following data:
	- stock ticker
	- volume weighted average
	- choose by sector
	- choose by stock
	- choose by revenue
	- choose by employee count/size
- can we filter the info that shows up per dot?  so initially when the map loads we have some of the data but you can add/take away the data you want to see...

- side note on machine training: 
- all floats are converted to ints, floats can't be used to train models
	- don't need to train on latitude and longitude (really only needed for the interactive map), we can just use city as a converted categorical variable
