3/11/22 - Friday's Agenda

#1 Branches: 
Good to see everyone having completed branches and commits to https://github.com/kjkubik/CompanyLocationAndStocks/branches!
What about Miss Sarah?

#2 Show-and-Tell:
We all present the code we have entered into the repository. 
What are we ready to deliver so far?


#3 WE NEED TO GET README IN PLACE AND THE MODEL(S) WE ARE EXPECTING TO USE

Here is some of what I have written today: 

Presentation (30 points) README: 
### Topic Selected:  Our topic is visualizing stock performance and future outlook. 
We are selecting this topic because we are interested in seeing if there is a multiple linier regression model that can assist in predicting what a stock might look like ‘future wise’ given the past two years of data.
We are also wanting to create a visualization where we can see how all top 100 NASDAQ stocks are performing compared to other companies based on their location. 
The data we are choosing comes from two sources: 
1)	Polygon’s REST API – We are able to gain two years’ worth of NASDAQ data from the top 100 companies. 
2)	geopy.geocoders (MONDO…I need a description, please)


The two major questions we want to address are: 

•	Is there a good multiple linear regression model able to predict stocks’ performance?
•	When compared to other stocks, is there a correlation between a company’s headquarters and the stocks daily performance?

### Description of the communication protocols: 
We were able to set up this schedule so that our team can meet on a regular basis: 
Monday 8PM
Tuesday (during class)
Thursday (during class)
Saturday (during office hours)
Sunday Meeting with Alexia: 
•	3/6 – with Nikita 
•	3/13 – with Mando 
•	3/20 – with Kim
•	3/27 – with Sarah
Individual Branches (RED)
 
## Machine Learning Model

### we only know that we are wanting to use a multiple linear model or something like it.

Thanks,
Kim





3/5/22

Mission/Vision: predict what potential stock performance will look like over the next year based on the past two years.
 
Getting Data: 
	a. API stocks : Kim (polygon)
	b. address, long and lat: Mando (geoPy)
	c. percent stock changes : Nikita
	d. creation of 3 tables: Alexis and Sarah

These are the three tables: 
Ticker_Name			Ticker_Daily_Stat			Ticker_Location	
-----------                     -----------------                       ---------------
Ticker	(primary)			Ticker 	(primary)			Ticker 	(primary)
Company_Name				Open						Address	
							Close						City		
							Change |(O-C)|				State	
							volumn 						Country	
							high						Longitude	
							low							Latitude	
							percent_changes				

	
*** Note : When you are done with something, check and see if anyone else is needing help. 
(Right now Mando may need help with the company listing.)

Monday Night Check 8 PM : (OR please if you cannot make it, please do #1 below in slack)

	We meet for one hour to do the following: 
		1. first 15 minutes: (STAND-UP)
			a. What we did. 
			b. what we are going to do.
			c. what do we need help with.
		2. help each other where we are stuck (if we can)

Alexis (You are not the forgotten dog.) Nikita will meet you this Sunday. Mando will meet you the next Sunday. I will meet with you the 3rd Sunday and Sarah will meet with you the 4th Sunday.
