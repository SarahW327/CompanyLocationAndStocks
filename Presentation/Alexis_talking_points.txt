1. As stated earlier we wanted to see if a companyâ€™s stock would increase/decrease depending on the region it is located.
    If we were looking at how stock changed during the pandemic would we see a decrease in first year of pandemic, and then a rise in some stocks up until current.

2. We were approaching our answer on whether there's a correlation between stock performance and company location.
    The information we have is the start of an analysis for getting the results with more time we could find the correlationbetween them.
3. For the future of this analysis, we would need to incorporate more data on stocks (ex: companys startup location vs todays location)
        which woud require more time to extract the data and compare the results of the locations.
    In that comparison we would need to evaluate if the cities are big/small and how they their economic structure began and is current.
    In order to reach our final analysis time is needed to gather all required data and make the final comparison. 
    Lastly the machine learning model we used may nothave best fit the information we need to make our analysis, for the future it would be great to try 
        a different machine learning model (do research on which machine best serves the data we are using)
